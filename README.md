# CRG R intermediate course: tidyverse 2021

## Title

Intermediate R course: Introduction to data wrangling with the tidyverse

## About the course

The so-called [**tidyverse** set of packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is widely used in the R community for powerful and efficient data reading, tidying, manipulation and visualization. It is one of the most popular and up-to-date set of tools for data analysis and data science using the R language.
<br> 
All **tidyverse** packages share a common vocabulary/grammar that makes code more intuitive and easier to read that the *base* R.
<br>
This 8-hour training aims at introducing some of the **tidyverse** packages for data wrangling and manipulation: dplyr, tidyr, stringr and readr.<br>
